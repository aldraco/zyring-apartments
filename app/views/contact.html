  <p>I'm a full-stack Javascript web developer, and I am <strong>available for hire.</strong></p>
  <h3>Education</h3>
  <p>I'm a self-taught developer. In an age where high-quality free resources abound, there is little excuse for someone like me being able to teach themselves how to program.</p>
  <p>I have spent much of my learning time doing Free Code Camp, an online bootcamp that focuses on full-stack Javascript. Through this program, I have been able to contribute to the <a href="http://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp">Free Code Camp Github repo</a>, as well as contribute a few teaching exercises.</p>
  <p>Check out my <a href="http://aldraco.github.io">portfolio</a> for more information.</p>
